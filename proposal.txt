The main goal of the project is analyzing the music trends and gathering the statistics of the most popular
artists/bands over the time.

1. Acquiring data:
The data will be parsed mostly from three webpages listed below:
- https://kworb.net/ - the warehouse of all the statistics about artists taken from the most popular music
services. It also has archive data so the analysis is possible.
- https://www.everynoise.com/,
https://www.aaemusic.com/browse-artists-by-genre/,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_musicians_by_genre -
these sites will be used to analyze the data based on music genres. The dependencies we observe should also
be influenced by the genre we consider. There is no some ideal source with all the data that will be used because
the data about music genres is difficult to maintain and actualize so the final dataset probably will be
constructed from different parts.

Probably, the data parsing will be done by using Python and its parsers like Beautiful Soup, etc. The final
result should be saved as csv file because it is easier to process.

2. Preprocessing data to a suitable form:
- Use some Python libraries (pandas, numpy, scipy) to put all the files together, preprocess the data,
work with bad inputs, and compute the basic statistics. The dataset will be saved as a csv file.
- Create a database (and its schema) using sqlite3 and csv files. Probably, the database will consist of three
tables keeping the information about the artists, music genres and the main one with all the statistics.

3. Further analyses and data visualization:
- The visualizations describing dependencies between music genres and the number of listeners, some artist`s
popularity trend, differences between music services (probably, different recommendation systems will cause
some changes in chart positions) will be shown either via basic Python visualization tools
(matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) or on some simple Flask application with the option to check the particular
artist`s stats.
