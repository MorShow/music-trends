            <strong>First graph:</strong> Z-distribution of the artist's popularity in a particular region. It was evaluated
            as a ratio of total (sum of all streams) number of streams of a singer over the overall number of streams
            thorough all the artists inside this region. Then the corresponding Z-values were created from these ratios.
            Logarithmic transformation is used to create steadier distribution (but even so it's still right-skewed,
            there are some artists that far away from the rest, which is quite expected for the music industry nowadays).

            <strong>Second graph:</strong> Treemap describing share of each artist's track from the total number of streams.
            We can see that very often the artist has one-two "bangers" who make him very popular. But also there are very
            "stable" artists with lots of equally popular tracks. The graph is quite interesting: we can get to know
            the musician or band much better it we look at it!

    <div id="plot2" style="width: 80%; margin: auto; height: 700px;"></div>
    <script>
        const plotData2 = {{ graphs[1] | tojson }};
        Plotly.newPlot('plot2', plotData2.data, plotData2.layout);

    <div style="max-width: 1000px; margin: auto; padding: 15px;">
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            <strong>Third graph:</strong> How much does it depend on featuring with another artist? Does it make
            a musician any popular? Of course. Here you can see how much "traffic" they get collaborating with others,
            and who gets popular on his own the most. The figures are divided into 10-artists batches
            to compare only equally popular ones and not to overwhelm the bar plots.
