            <strong>First graph:</strong> Does the popularity of some music depend on time periods/seasons?
            You can check it looking at this graph. It describes the most popular artists and how much
            their popularity depends on actual month.
            The radio was chosen as the main source. To my mind, it is affected by seasons of the year
            the most.

            <strong>Second graph:</strong> YouTube video clips versus Spotify songs. Who does get more traffic?
            Of course, it was quite expected that the latter, but there are interesting occasions when
            the video was even more popular than the track. It also depends on the date when a clip was published
            because the music services were not developed as well as video services at some point of time.

            <strong>Third graph:</strong> How popular some video clips remain today? Does it depend on
            publication date? Check it. The figures for each year from 2010 (and earlier) to 2023 will probably
            help you to figure this out!
